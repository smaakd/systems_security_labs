# lab 1
It is about identifying and exploiting the bufferoverflow vulnerabilties of a teaching web-server called zoobar. Here we explore and write exploits to perform buffer overflow attacks in different conditions like with/without excecutable stack. The exploit-3.py contains code to perform bufferoverflow in executable stack condition. exploit-4a.py contains code for attcaking a non-executable stack web-server.
